                    A matured flower as beautiful as FLORA, <br/>
                    Treated and nurtured with love by her
                    Gardener&#39;s. <br/>
                    Became the best one in the Nursery, <br/>
                    But had a Helping heart and reached the
                    Forest. <br/>
                    Forest stood up on its characteristic, <br/>
                    Animals floricide that flower. <br/>
                    Gardener still regrets that he sowed that
                    flower. <br/>
                    Although Many Gardeners stood up for him, 
                    Yet the justice hasn&#39;t prevailed. <br/>
                    This isn&#39;t about flowers, and the gardeners
                    were dads, <br/>
                    Even a petal wasn&#39;t left, got treated worse
                    than the deads <br/> <br/>

                    &#40; We hope she reincarnate as CHLORIS &#41;
